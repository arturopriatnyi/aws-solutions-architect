How to choose an AWS Region?
- **Compliance with data governance and legal requirements:** data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
- **Proximity to customers:** reduced latency.
- **Available services within a Region:** new services and new features arenâ€™t available in every Region.
- **Pricing:** pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.
