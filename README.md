# AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) course notes

## Intro

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is a Cloud Provider. They provide you with servers and services that you can use *on demand* and *scale easily*.

Services examples:

## Geography

### Regions
AWS *has regions all around the world*.

> Region is a cluster of data centers.

Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-2 and etc. Most AWS services are region-scoped.

</p>

How to choose an AWS Region?
- **Compliance with data governance and legal requirements:** data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
- **Proximity to customers:** reduced latency.
- **Available services within a Region:** new services and new features aren’t available in every Region.
- **Pricing:** pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.

### Availability Zones (AZ)

Each *region has many availability zones* (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6). Example:

</p>

- Each availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity.
- They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters.
- They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.

### Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
Amazon has *216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & || Regional Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries*. Content is delivered to end users with *lower latency*.

**IAM** is **Identity and Access Management** service.

- It is **Global**.
- **Root account** created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared.
- **Users** are people within your organisation, and can be **grouped**.

### Users & Groups

**User** represents one user in your organisation. User can be grouped together in **Groups**.

</p>

- Groups only contain users, not other groups.
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.
